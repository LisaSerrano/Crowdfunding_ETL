ETL Project Debrief Questions: 


What are the challenges associated with ETL?
    With ELT we definitely see the benefits and how it would help with real world scenerios. But the challanges that can come with ETL is when we dont have comments to guide use through each step of how to clean up the data. In this case, figuring out where to start and what is the most effective way to make the data the most legible when working with so much data at once. Also working with so much data in the past has lead to preformance issues with servers if not designed to handle so much information.

What are the benefits?

We see alot of real life benefits with ETL! It makes it easier to collaborate and share compact data that will be easier to understand and analyze. ETL makes it easier for businesses to analyze data that is relevant to their initiatives to be able to come up with better gameplans to impove their business.


How might ETL changes when moving to cloud?

The ELT might change when moving to the cloud in assisting automating task involved in the ETL process like Data quaily, data ingestion, transformation. Also the cloud can make it easier to optain other data such as social media or other open data sources. 
However a con of moving ETL to the cloud might be when moving the data if not pushing the progress correctly. Also if mutiple people are working on the same data making sure noone is overwriting the data and only working out of their branches.
